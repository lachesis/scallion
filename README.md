Scallion
========
Scallion lets you make create .onion addresses for [Tor's](https://www.torproject.org/) [hidden services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services) using OpenCL. It is based in part on [shallot](https://github.com/katmagic/Shallot) and inspired by [vanitygen](https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen). The OpenCL SHA-1 implementation was adapted from [NearSHA](http://cr.yp.to/nearsha.html).

Scallion runs on Mono (tested in Arch Linux) and .NET 3.5 (tested on Windows 7 and Server 2008). It includes components from [OpenTK](http://www.opentk.com/) and [OpenSSL-net](http://openssl-net.sourceforge.net/).

Scallion is currently in beta stage and under active development. Nevertheless, we feel that it is ready for use. Improvements are expected primarily in performance, user interface, and ease of installation, not in the overall algorithm used to generate keys.

Scallion is available under the MIT licence. If you use code from this project in your own projects, we'd appreciate hearing about it at scallion@aftbit.com.

Speed
-----
On my nVidia Quadro K2000M, I see around 90 MH/s. With those speeds, I can generate a six character prefix in about six seconds on average. An eight character prefix would take about 1h 45m. To calculate the number of seconds required for a given prefix (on average), use this formula:

    seconds = 2^(5*length-1) / hashspeed 
 
My friend's AMD Radeon HD6850 gets 600 MH/s. That's a 300x speedup over shallot. With that speed, he can find an eight character prefix in just 15 minutes on average.

Security
--------
The keys generated by Scallion are quite similar to those generated by shallot. They have unusually large public exponents, but they are put through the full set of sanity checks recommended by PKCS #1 v2.1 via openssl's RSA_check_key function. In general, however, tor's (and Scallion's) default 1024-bit key is starting to [look a little small](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2011-November/003033.html). Scallion supports several RSA key sizes, with optimized kernels for 1024b, 2048b, and 4096b. Other key sizes may work, but have not been tested.
